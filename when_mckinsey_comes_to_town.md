The pacing can be slow at times but the stories are all interesting

## Summary

A collection of short stories spanning the business world but all projects
in which McKinsey and its partners has had influence. All of these have
negative undertones which are carried through the story and show the impact
McKinsey is having on the broader world even though it preaches doing good.

## Refresher (Spoilers)

1. Values that they preach, mainly doing good and leaving a positive impact
2. Working for the government such as the FDA while also working with drug makers
3. Working with ICE and leading and pushing for a lot of "cost saving" reforms that lead or would have lead to far worse living conditions for those in detention
4. Working with the Chinese government and helping them become more globalized
5. Tobacco and Vaping working with some of the most dangerous problems to health while at the same time denying and covering up the work
6. Working with opiod companies mainly Purdue but basically all of them and how they influenced a lot of the aggresive sales pitches which lead to the devastating numbers of the opiod epidemic
7. On Wall Street McKinsey and former partners were instrumental in creating the securities that helped cause the financial crisis in 2008
8. Working with Insurance companies, McKinsey was a key player in devloping and pushing software that led to lower payouts and more calculated risks by Insurance companies instead of helping the people needing the money.

10. McKinsey had no qualms working with South Africa during apartheid and supported whoever was willing to give them money
11. Saudi Arabia has been quite contentious in recent history especially the assasination of journalist Jhamal Khasoggi, McKinsey seemed to have their hands in a lot of porjects in the Saudi state a lot of times blurring the lines from consulting and insider. They led research into social media dissidents
12. Britain and the NHS, how britain used to have one of the most cost effective and efficient medical systems in the world and how McKinsey coming in and pushing for change has led to significantly worse treatment and worse waiting times by leading for privatization of lots of parts
