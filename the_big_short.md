üëçHighly recommended for anyone interested in the Stock Market crash in 2007/2008, the housing crisis, or business books.

## Summary
As a big fan of Michael Lewis' writing I was sure to like this and it definitely came through. The story revolves around two main characters who foresaw the housing bubble and the ensuing crash. It's a riveting tale following some of the main actors and quit funny to listen to people sell products they don't understand and how the train kept rolling. It's as much informative as it is entertaining a hallmark of Michael Lewis.

### Refresher (Spoilers)
The main characters and most entertaining in the book were Michael Bury, and Steve Eisman. Bury founded Scion Capital, he was going through Med school at Stanford before and was posting value investing picks in online forums. Scion had great success using value investing and made returns far greater than the average market. After studying and predicting the subprime mortgage bond market he shifted investments that way leading to lots of questions from investors even though he had great returns on all his other investments. In the end he was right but resented his investors. Eisman is definitely the most entertaining character in the book someone with an idgaf attitude and he lives it by always being right. Eisman was always very vulgar and seemed constantly on the edge but also predicted the crashand made lots of money for his fund. There are many more characters but these are the most prevalent. Business wise, the creationg of these packaged mortgages into bonds allowed lenders to lend more and repeat the cycle. The problems came with special rates and lending to people who normally wouldn't receive a mortgage leading to the downward spiral and eventual collapse of the bonds. The Financial working were quite difficult to understand and I still don't fully. The main way the investors made money on the crash was credit swaps which is basically insurance on a bond, where you pay a premium every month, usually a fraction of the bond yield and if the bond defaults the issuer pays you the whole value of the bond. This is how the winners in the book made the majority of their money.
