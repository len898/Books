## Summary/Review
A book within a book within a book. Going into this one blind was quite interesting. The story is set in the 1920's and the rise of a Wall Street Tycoon. The story is pieced together using 3 different books, and 1 first hand account by a narrator. Each book is written from a different point of view and views the story in a different way. The first has a People magazine spin to it, the second is by the person involved and semi auto-biographical, the third story is the origin of the autobiography and the fourth is the diary of an involved person. Overall this book was very interesting and peeling back the layers and combining the stories was a thrilling process. I finished most of this book on a flight and it was great to keep the time going. 
### Refresher (Spoilers)
The first story is written by an alleged "friend" and paints the main character Benjamin Rask and Helen Rask in a quite unfavorable light. Rask comes of as weird and like a megamind who engineered the great depression. The second book is the one Rask hires to be written about him, since he passes during the writing it has incomplete sections and fills in certain aspects of the story. While reading this second novel we get the behind the scenes of the actual writing which gives us a first hand account of what Rask was actually like and it fills in some of the puzzle pieces of his personality. It also shows the way he tries to engineer the story to make Helen look a very specific way. The last "book" is the journal found by the author of the biography which was written by Helen at the end of her days with Cancer. In this book we find out that Helen was responsible for most of the success during the great depression experiences by the Rasks, and that her husband resented her for being better than him and having a better rounded view of the financial markets. It turns out she foresaw the crash and made all the bets to weather the storm and come out way on top.
